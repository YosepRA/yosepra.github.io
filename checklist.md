# Project Checklist

Random ideas and concerns while on development. These may or may not be implemented on future updates.

Finished items will have âœ… mark beside it.

## New Features

- Hero header typewriter effect.
- "Connecting dots" background SVG assets. Also add parallax.
- "Why do you need web application" section to have a graphic-text zig-zag pattern.
- More prominent project section. Play with thumbnails to create a striking effects.
- Contact "copy" button.

## Fix/Refactor

- Footer margin top. Manage spacing with contact section.
- "WhyWebApplication" component cleanup.
- Bootstrap `Col` to be the direct container of each page section.  
  There is no need for the unnecessary nested structure.
- More uniform way of overriding Bootstrap styles.  
  Right now, I'm overidding it with direct Bootstrap class override, and the other is to have an "active" class to disable certain style rules in the same SCSS module file.
